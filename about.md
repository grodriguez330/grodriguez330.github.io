I am 23 years old, live in Boston, MA and currently working as a level two Technical Support Representative at LogMeIn. I am dedicating a lot of my time to learning how to code as this is where I want my career to go. Currently trying to complete the Full Stack Web Developer NanoDegree by Udacity.com.
